In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory and server components with specific data fetching strategies.  Consider a scenario where you fetch data within a server component using `fetch` or a similar method.  If this data fetch operation fails (e.g., due to a network error or a server-side issue), the error isn't always handled gracefully. The application might crash silently, or the error might not propagate correctly to the client-side resulting in a blank screen or unexpected behavior. This is especially tricky to debug because it happens server-side, and traditional client-side error handling mechanisms might not catch it.
